# memory-schema plugin for Claude Code

Content-agnostic memory system with 7-space embedding and variance-weighted retrieval. This plugin provides hooks, rules, and skills — it wraps the `memory-schema` Python package (installed separately via pip).

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install memory-schema[all]
```

The plugin does not bundle the source code. It calls the pip-installed `memoryschema` package via the hook and CLI commands. Without the package installed, the hook and skills will not function.

## Installation

### From local development checkout

```bash
# Clone the repo and install in editable mode
git clone <repo-url> memory-schema
cd memory-schema
pip install -e .[all,dev]

# The plugin directory is at .claude-plugin/ — point Claude Code to it
```

### Environment

```bash
# Required for semantic search (optional — degrades to keyword search without it)
export VOYAGE_API_KEY=voy-xxxxx
```

## What the plugin provides

### Hook: PostToolUse (Write or Edit)

Fires on every Write or Edit to `memory/*.md`. The hook:

1. Parses the `<memory:entity>` XML
2. Checks authorisation (only the active chain or new entities can be written)
3. Embeds across 7 spaces (default, name, description, observations, prompt, reasoning, chain)
4. Computes divergence profile (per-space distance from default)
5. Runs the write gate (validation, consistency, numeric probe, L0 echo)
6. Indexes to Neo4j (primary) or JSONL (fallback)
7. Updates MEMORY.md with L0 budget enforcement
8. Touches sentinel for Stop hook chain-update check

### Hook: Stop (chain update reminder)

Fires at the end of every Claude response. If an active chain exists (`memory/.active_chain`) but no memory write occurred during the response (sentinel absent), injects a reminder via `systemMessage` to update the chain entity.

### Hook management

- `memoryschema hook status` — shows version (v0/v1/v2), staleness, script health
- `memoryschema hook upgrade` — upgrades stale installations (Write→Write|Edit, adds Stop hook)
- `memoryschema hook check` — runs 8 diagnostic checks (script existence, executability, dry-run)
- `memoryschema hook scan` — finds all installations across projects, reports version table

### Chain reasoning accumulation

For chain entities (`chain-*` prefix), reasoning accumulates across updates with `---` separators, preserving the narrative evolution. Standalone entities replace reasoning on each update.

### Rules

- **memory-schema.md** — Schema rules (entity structure, fields, relations, scoring, storage)
- **memory-working.md** — Working memory guidelines (recall before responding, chain lifecycle)

### Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/recall <query>` | Semantic search with dual-store support (project + user-level) |
| `/chain-start <name>` | Start a reasoning chain (authorise for writes) |
| `/chain-status` | Show the active chain |
| `/chain-release` | Release the active chain (make read-only) |
| `/memory-status` | Show store backend, node count, embedding coverage |
| `/bootstrap` | Scan project docs and source, create knowledge map as memory entities |

## Architecture

```
Plugin (.claude-plugin/)               Python package (pip-installed)
─────────────────────────              ────────────────────────────────
hooks/hooks.json  ──calls──>           hook-post-write.sh ──imports──> memoryschema.*

Data (hybrid scope)
───────────────────
Project: memory/store.jsonl, *.md      (project-specific memories)
User:    ~/.claude/memory/store.jsonl   (cross-project knowledge, fallback)
```

## Hybrid memory scope

The plugin supports both project-level and user-level memory:

- **Project store**: `memory/` directory in the project root — isolated per project
- **User store**: `~/.claude/memory/` — cross-project knowledge, used as fallback

The hook writes to whichever store the file path resolves to. If no project `memory/` directory can be derived from the path, it falls back to `~/.claude/memory/`.

The `/recall` skill searches the project store first, then the user-level store for cross-project context.

## Quick start

1. Install the package: `pip install memory-schema[all]`
2. Initialize a project: `memoryschema init --project my-project --scopes working`
3. Set your Voyage key: `export VOYAGE_API_KEY=voy-xxxxx`
4. Write a memory — Claude will auto-index it via the hook
5. Use `/recall` to search memories
6. Use `/chain-start` to begin a reasoning chain
